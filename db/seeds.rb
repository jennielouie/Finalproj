Crochet 2 htr together to 1 htr as follows:
Crochet 1 htr, but wait with last yarn over and ‘pull through’ (= 3 sts on hook), crochet following htr but now draw last yarn over through all 5 sts on hook – it is now dec 1 htr.



Mitten: Read Crochet info!


   * Crochet 22 loose ch with hook size 6 mm and Alaska (ch-band shall measure approx 20 cm,) and form a ring with 1 sl st in 1st ch.

   * Crochet 3 rounds with htr by crocheting in back loop - crochets 1 htr in every ch = 22 htr.

   * Then crochet htr around by crocheting through both loops.

   * When piece measures 13 cm make an opening for thumb by crocheting 4 loose ch in the beg of round, skip following 4 htr and continue with htr around as before (opening for thumb ís approx 4 cm,).

   * On next round crochet 1 htr in 4 ch that was crocheted ´for thumb-opening = 22 htr.

   * Continue around until piece measures 21 cm, or to desired length (it remains approx 3 cm to finished measure).

   * Now dec by crocheting 2 by 2 htr tog all around the round– read instruction above = 11 htr.

   * Crochet 1 round without dec, then crochet 1 round at the same time as dec like earlier = 6 htr.

   * Crochet 1 round again with dec the same way = 3 htr.

   * Pull thread through remaining sts and pull together, sew away ends.





Thumb: Crochet 8 htr around opening on thumb (1 htr in 4 skipped sts and 1 htr in 4 ch above these).
Crochet htr around as before by crocheting through both loops.
When thumb measures approx 5 cm (or desired length) crochet 1 round at the same time as dec by crocheting 2 by 2 htr tog around = 4 htr.
Pull thread through remaining sts and pull together, sew away ends.
Crochet 1 more mitten the same way.



Crocheted edge:
Crochet around edge on mitten with hook size 6 mm with Puddel as follows:
1st row: 1 dc in 1st htr (start on inside of mitten), * 3 ch, skip 1 htr, 1 dc in following htr *, repeat *-* and finish with 3 ch.
2nd row: Crochet the same way as 1st round but crochet first dc in 2nd htr so that the two rounds works in every other htr.



Decoration: Crochet one simple pattern on upper side of mitten with hook size 6 mm and with Puddel.
Crochet * 1 dc through htr on mitten, 2 ch *, repeat *-* and finish with 1 sl st through 1 htr on mitten."})

Row 1: ch 11, sc in 2nd ch from hook and in each ch across, ch1, turn (10 sc)
Row 2: sc in first sc, bpsc (picture#1) in the other 9 sc across, ch1, turn (10 sc)
Rows 3- 32: repeat row 2 (32 rows total) be sure to regular sc in first st, and bpsc in the other 9, this will give a ridged look (picture#2)
Fasten off leaving long tail for sewing.  Whip stitch together to make a tube. (picture#3)

Now you will begin the palm of the glove, working in rounds
Round 1: Attach the yarn with a slst to either end of the cuff,(picture#4) ch 1, sc in same spot slst was made, sc evenly around cuff for a total of 32 sc, join with slst to first sc

Round 4-6: repeat round 3 (you can lengthen or shorten the glove at this point, if you have a smaller hand do not make as many rounds, if you want your glove to cover more of your wrist and forearms you can add more rounds.
Round 7: beginning of thumb opening: Continue same as round 2 until you complete 6 fans stitches, turn
Round 8:  slst in next 2 dc, slst in ch 1 space, ch2, dc, ch 1, 2 dc in same ch 1 space (picture#12).  Continue fnst around ch1 spaces (6 fnst) ch3; join round with slst to top of ch 2 of beginning of same round (picture#13), ch 1, turn
